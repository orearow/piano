Hello there. My name is Ore Arowobusoye. I have been playing piano since I was a little girl and I have a real
    passion for music.
    <P> Currently, I have completed up to level 7 with the canadian royal conservatory of music, and received honours on
    my level 7 exam. I first started teaching piano with a program called heart of the city that offers
        free music lessons for low income families. These days I am teaching my own students with my piano at home .</P>


    <h3>my other hobbies include </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>drinking tea</li>
        <li>writing stories</li>
        <li>reading novels</li>
        <li>singing (I'm in chamber choir too!)</li>

    </ul>
    <!--<p>I have been playing piano for a very long time<p>-->
